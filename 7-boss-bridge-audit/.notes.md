each vault works with one token

How signing works:
1. Take private key + message (data, function selector, parameters)
2. Smash it into Elliptic curve Digital Signature algorithm
   1. This outputs v,r and s
   2. We can use these values to verify someones signature using ecrecover


How verifying works:
1. Get the signed message
   2. Break it into v,r and s
2. Get the data itself
3. Use it as input patameters for `ecrecover`
